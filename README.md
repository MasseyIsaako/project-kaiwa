# Project Kaiwa

This is a chat application created using React, Socket.io and Node.js. The word "Kaiwa" is japanese for "conversation". This application was built following the YouTube tutorial created by JavaScript Mastery. Here is the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFA3YMfkoc.

To get started, ensure that all dependencies in both `server` and `client` folders have been installed and that you have started the servers. In separate terminal windows, run the below commands from the root project folder:

 - Setup `client` folder: `cd client && npm i && npm start`.
 - Setup `server` folder: `cd server && npm i && npm start`.
